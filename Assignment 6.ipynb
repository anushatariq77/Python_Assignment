    "### 1. CLASS:\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).\n",
    "### 2. OBJECT :\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process.\n",
    "### 3. ATTRIBUTE:\n",
    "In Object-oriented programming(OOP), classes and objects have attributes. Attributes are data stored inside a class and represent the state or quality of the class.\n",
    "### 4. BEHAVIOR:\n",
    "A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. \n"
